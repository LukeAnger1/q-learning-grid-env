# Q-Learning in Grid World Environments

This project focuses on implementing and demonstrating the Q-learning algorithm in two classic grid world environments: FrozenLake and TaxiV3. Q-learning is a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn optimal actions through exploration and exploitation.

## Introduction to Q-Learning

Q-Learning is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm used to find the optimal action-selection policy for a given finite Markov decision process (MDP). It's one of the foundational techniques in reinforcement learning and has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems. Q-learning aims to learn a Q-value function that represents the expected cumulative reward an agent can obtain by taking a certain action in a given state.

## Grid World Environments

This repository includes implementations for two classic grid world environments:

1. **FrozenLake**: A simple grid world where the agent must navigate across a frozen lake while avoiding holes. The agent receives a reward of +1 for reaching the goal state and a reward of 0 otherwise.

2. **TaxiV3**: An environment where the agent controls a taxi navigating through a city grid to pick up and drop off passengers at designated locations. The agent receives rewards based on its actions and progress towards delivering passengers.
